# esgfpy-solr
Python client library to interact with the ESGF Solr catalogs.
Using this module requires no authentication or authorization, since the client sends HTTP request to the Solr update URL which is
assumed to be freely available (typically, on a restricted port such as 8984 to clients on localhost).
